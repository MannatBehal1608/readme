good evening everyone !
explanation for mini project by Mannat Behal :
introduction: both the codes hold an accuracy of almost 78 percent. the logic of the code goes this way:
1.importing all the valuable libraries needed
2.access the diabetes.csv file form the mini project into the google Collab where I executed the code. 
3.check if the data is running or not 
4. identification of empty values using isna()
5. removal of the empty values via drop() or fill the empty space with the help of mean, median via fillna() method.
6. same goes for if there is any duplicate column or repetitive code found, it will be removed.
7. now the graphical explanation is provided with the help of :
    (I)histograph
    (II) correlation heatmap chart 
8. now remove the columns if they are reluctant to strong correlation to increase the accuracy 
    (I)miniproject states the accuracy when only three columns are removed 
     (II)miniproject1 claims when more columns are removed 
9. testing and training model is installed.
10. accuracy is being checked at the end
